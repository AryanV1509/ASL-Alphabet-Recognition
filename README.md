# ASL-Alphabet-Recognition
This repository contains the implementation of an American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that identifies alphabet letters from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aims to facilitate communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating ASL gestures into textual representation.
## Features
- **Dataset Preparation:** Preprocessing and augmentation of ASL alphabet images to enhance the model's performance and generalization.
- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of a CNN model tailored for image classification, optimized for recognizing ASL alphabet letters.
- **Training and Validation:** Scripts to train the model on the ASL dataset with options for adjusting hyperparameters and tracking performance metrics.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's accuracy and robustness using various evaluation techniques and visualizations.
- **Prediction:** A script to make predictions on new ASL images, enabling real-time ASL recognition.
- **User Interface:** A simple UI to capture images from a webcam and display the predicted ASL alphabet letter.
## Dataset
The project utilizes a publicly available ASL alphabet dataset from Kaggle consisting of images for each letter of the alphabet. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure reliable model evaluation.
